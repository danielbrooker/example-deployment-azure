### Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files, and additional references, have been used and tested to generate a live ELK deployment in the Azure cloud service.
_They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ _file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._

.This document contains the following details:

* Description of the Topology
* Access Policies
* ELK Configuration
  - Beats in Use
  - Machines Being Monitored
* How to Use the Ansible Build


### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly _avaliable_, in addition to restricting _direct access_ to the network.


_In a security context, the primary advantage of using a load balancer is to remove direct access from the Internet to the web servers. Incoming web traffic must traverse the load balancer prior to being passed to the actual web servers. Therefore, the load balancer provides an extra layer of security, and mitigation for attacks such as DDoS._

_Additionally, a 'jumpbox' has been made use of, and SSH access to the web servers have been restricted to this virtual machine [ e.g. SSH access to the web servers is only possible via the 'jumpbox' ]. Use of a 'jumpbox' reduces the amount of admistration interfaces that are exposed to the public Internet, and provides a single, centralized [ and auditable ] location to administer resources within the Azure enviroment._

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _system's configuration_ and system _files_.

- _Filebeat is designed to monitor log files on a local computer, and then to perodically parse these log files and foward to a centralized storage solution [ e.g. Elasticsearch ]._

- _Metricbeat is designed to periodically report specific metrics from the local computer's operating system [ e.g. CPU load, memory usage, services/processes, etc. ] and specific applications/services [ e.g. Apache, MongoDB, MySQL, etc. ] back to a centralized storage solution  [ e.g. Elasticsearch ]._

- _winLogBeat is designed to monitor the Event Logs from a Windows computer, and then perodically parse and forward these to a centralized storage solution [ e.g. Elasticsearch ]._

The configuration details of each virtual machine in the Azure enviroment are below :

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

The only network resources _directly_ accessible from the public Internet are as follows :

.Azure Resources - Directly accessible via public Internet
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Hostname|Public IP Address | F.Q.D.N. | Access Protocols
|VM-ELK01 | 20.198.240.164 | monitoring.SideProjectA.com | Kibana [ 5601 ] ; Elasticsearch [ 9200 ] |VM-JumpBox | 20.40.72.141 | jump.SideProjectA.com | SSH [ 22 ]
|Web Load Balancer | 20.53.90.29 | dvwa.SideProjectA.com | HTTP [ 80 ]
|=======================

The specific Inbound/Outbound Access Rules for the two Azure Network Security Groups are listed in detail below.
The following is a high-level summary/outline :

* Only the 'jumpbox', ELK stack VM and load balance for the web server farm have _direct_ inbound access from the public Internet.
* Administration of the web server VMs is _only_ via SSH from the 'jumpbox'.
* Access to the 'jumpbox' is _only_ via SSH, and _only_ from one external IP address [ xxx.69.44.210 ].
* Access to the ELK stack VM is _only_ via Port 5601 and 9200, and _only_ from two external IP addresses [ xxx.254.27.242, xxx.69.44.210 ]

NOTE: Some IP addresses have been obfuscate for security reasons.

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
- ...
- ...

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your screenshot of docker ps output](Images/docker_ps_output.png)

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- _TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- _TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed_

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- _TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the _____ file to _____.
- Update the _____ file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
