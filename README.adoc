### Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

image::https://github.com/danielbrooker/example-deployment-azure/blob/main/ScreenShots/Week_12-Homework-Azure_Network_Diagram.png[Network Diagram]

These files, and additional references, have been used and tested to generate a live ELK deployment in the Azure cloud service.
_They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternately, selected playbooks can be run to install specific components [ e.g. filebeat ]._
_Ideally, given more time, the various playbooks should be combined/amalgimated, and the use of Ansible Roles used to provide a more complete/compact solution._
_All files and playbooks used for this enviroment can be found in this GitHub repository [ https://github.com/danielbrooker/example-deployment-azure/tree/main/Ansible ]._

.This document contains the following details:

* Description of the Topology
* Access Policies
* ELK Configuration
  - Beats in Use
  - Machines Being Monitored
* How to Use the Ansible Build


### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly _avaliable_, in addition to restricting _direct access_ to the network.


_In a security context, the primary advantage of using a load balancer is to remove direct access from the Internet to the web servers. Incoming web traffic must traverse the load balancer prior to being passed to the actual web servers. Therefore, the load balancer provides an extra layer of security, and mitigation for attacks such as DDoS._

_Additionally, a 'jumpbox' has been made use of, and SSH access to the web servers have been restricted to this virtual machine [ e.g. SSH access to the web servers is only possible via the 'jumpbox' ]. Use of a 'jumpbox' reduces the amount of admistration interfaces that are exposed to the public Internet, and provides a single, centralized [ and auditable ] location to administer resources within the Azure enviroment._

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _system's configuration_ and system _files_.

- _Filebeat is designed to monitor log files on a local computer, and then to perodically parse these log files and foward to a centralized storage solution [ e.g. Elasticsearch ]._

- _Metricbeat is designed to periodically report specific metrics from the local computer's operating system [ e.g. CPU load, memory usage, services/processes, etc. ] and specific applications/services [ e.g. Apache, MongoDB, MySQL, etc. ] back to a centralized storage solution  [ e.g. Elasticsearch ]._

- _winLogBeat is designed to monitor the Event Logs from a Windows computer, and then perodically parse and forward these to a centralized storage solution [ e.g. Elasticsearch ]._

The configuration details of each virtual machine in the Azure enviroment are below :

|=======================


### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

The only network resources _directly_ accessible from the public Internet are as follows :

.Azure Resources - Directly accessible via public Internet
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Hostname|Public IP Address | F.Q.D.N. | Access Protocols
|VM-ELK01 | 20.198.240.164 | monitoring.SideProjectA.com | Kibana [ 5601 ] ; Elasticsearch [ 9200 ] |VM-JumpBox | 20.40.72.141 | jump.SideProjectA.com | SSH [ 22 ]
|Web Load Balancer | 20.53.90.29 | dvwa.SideProjectA.com | HTTP [ 80 ]
|=======================

The specific Inbound/Outbound Access Rules for the two Azure Network Security Groups are listed in detail below.
The following is a high-level summary/outline :

* Only the 'jumpbox', ELK stack VM and load balance for the web server farm have _direct_ inbound access from the public Internet.
* Administration of the web server VMs is _only_ via SSH from the 'jumpbox'.
* Access to the 'jumpbox' is _only_ via SSH, and _only_ from one external IP address [ xxx.69.44.210 ].
* Access to the ELK stack VM is _only_ via Port 5601 and 9200, and _only_ from two external IP addresses [ xxx.254.27.242, xxx.69.44.210 ]

NOTE: Some IP addresses have been obfuscate for security reasons.

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. Automation of software deployment and configuration via Ansible provides the following advantages :

- Using a predefined Ansible playbook ensures that software is deployed and configured in an identical manner across all targeted machines.
- Usage of an Ansible playbook simplifies the testing of deployment/configuration in a development enviroment, and subsiqent deployment to the prodution enviroment [ e.g. as the same playbook is used, we can be sure that all aspects are correctly/completely migrated between enviroemnts ].
- Usage of Ansible enables administration, security, software and/or configuration changes to be rolled out to all machines in the enviroment quickly and indentially.
- Once developed, an Ansible playbook can be re-used to rebuild, or re-deploy, entire enviroments.

The ELK installation playbook implements the following tasks:
NOTE: ELK installation playbook is located at : https://github.com/danielbrooker/example-deployment-azure/blob/main/Ansible/install-elk.yml

- ELK is installed _only_ onto machines under the `elk` section in `hosts` file.
- Virtual memory for the ELK stack is set [ default values are likely to be too small ].
  [ Reference : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html ].
- `docker.io` installed [ Docker software for holding/managing containers ].
- `pip` package installer for Python installed, along with Docker Python module.
- ELK stack docker is downloaded, set to run and bound to specific Ports [ 5601 | 9200 | 5044 ]. [ The specific container used is `sebp/elk:761`[ sebp is the organization that made the container. elk is the container and 761 is the version ] ].
- Ensure that the Docker service is set to run on start-up [ to ensure that ELK stack starts automatically with VM ].

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance :

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:

.Azure Virtual Machines Monitored by ELK [ fileBeat & metricBeat ]
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Hostname|Function      |Internal IP Address
|VM-Web01 | Web Server |10.0.0.5
|VM-Web02 | Web Server |10.0.0.6
|VM-Web03 | Web Server |10.0.0.7
|=======================

.Physical Machines Monitored by ELK [ winLogBeat ]
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Hostname|Function      |Internal IP Address
|GN-WS-15 | Windows AutoCAD workstation |10.0.0.103
|GN-WS-16 | Windows AutoCAD workstation |10.0.0.122
|GN-WS-17 | Windows AutoCAD workstation |10.0.0.123
|=======================

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:

- _fileBeat is collecting and forwarding the standard Ubuntu log files from the web server VMs. Possible uses of the information collected by fileBeat could include : monitoring for unexpected usage of sudo, unexpected logons, repeated failed logon attempts, unexpected configuration changes, etc._

- _metricBeat is designed to periodically report specific metrics from the local computer's operating system to the ELK stack. Possible uses for the information gathered by metricBeat could include : determining the overall CPU, or memory, usage of a machine [ over time ]; spotting if machines are unecountering unscheduled or unexpected downtime; services or processes that are unexpectedly or continiously restarting, unexpected services, etc._

- _winLogBeat is monitor the Event Logs from a Windows computers, and then perodically forwarding them tothe ELK stack. Information gathered by winLogBeats can be used in a similar fashion to fileBeat [ e.g. monitoring for unexpected/failed logons, services continiously failing/restarted, etc. ]. Ideally, the installation of winLogBeat should be paired with the installation, and configuration, of SysMon [ to allow logging of more SIEM-focused items [ e.g. process creation events, command line activity, network connections, etc ]._

Screenshots of the various Kibana dashboards [ fileBeat, metricBeat, winLogBeat ] are found in the following location : https://github.com/danielbrooker/example-deployment-azure/tree/main/ScreenShots

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:

- Copy required playbook and configuration files into Ansible container [ on 'jumpbox VM '].
This is likely best acheived by installing `git` into the Ansible container, and then simply pulling this repository.
- Update/check `hosts` file to ensure that VMs are correctly assigned [ e.g. in the `elk` section ensure that this has the appropriate IP of the VM you will be making into an ELK server, the same goes for the `webservers` ].
A sample `hosts` file is at the following location : https://github.com/danielbrooker/example-deployment-azure/blob/main/Ansible/hosts
- The various playbooks can be run to install various different components [ as show below ]; as an example, the following command would run the playbook to installed the ELK stack `ansible-playbook install-elk.yml`.

.Ansible Playbooks
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Function|Playbook Name | Location | Comments
|Install ELK stack | `install-elk.yml` | https://github.com/danielbrooker/example-deployment-azure/blob/main/Ansible/install-elk.yml | This targets hosts under the `elk` section in the `hosts` file.
|Install DVWA | `install-pentest.yml` | https://github.com/danielbrooker/example-deployment-azure/blob/main/Ansible/install-pentest.yml | This targets hosts under the `webserver` section in the `hosts` file.
|Install metricBeat | `install-metricbeat.yml` | https://github.com/danielbrooker/example-deployment-azure/blob/main/Ansible/install-metricbeat.yml | Currently targeted on the `webservers` section in the `hosts` file.
|Install fileBeat |`install-filebeat.yml` | https://github.com/danielbrooker/example-deployment-azure/blob/main/Ansible/filebeat-config.yml | Currently targeted on the `webservers` section in the `hosts` file.
|=======================

NOTE: There is currently no Ansible playbook for the installation of winLogBeat; this was completed manually [ instructions via https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/164284-gathering-windows-powershell-and-sysmon-events-with-winlogbeat-elk-7-windows-server-2016-part-2 ]. The base configuration file [ `winlogbeat.yml` ] for winLogBeat is provided in the following location : https://github.com/danielbrooker/example-deployment-azure/blob/main/Ansible/files/winlogbeat.yml ].

- As well as monitoring the output from the Ansible playbook run, manual checks should also be run [ e.g. logging into the various machines, and confirming that the required Docker containers are present and running, and that the various services are accessible [ e.g. can the DVWA be accessed via a web browser ] ].

- To check that fileBeat, metricBeat, or winLogBeat are working as expected, open a web browser to `monitoring.SideProjectA.com:5600` and check the relevant Kibana Dashboards.
